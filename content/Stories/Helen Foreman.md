I do not know a great deal about [[FOREMAN, (1859) Helen "Nellie"|Aunt Nellie]]. She and brother [[FOREMAN, (1861) Edward Burr|Edward Burr]] arrived at New Zealand aboard the "[[Waimea]]". [[FOREMAN, (1859) Helen "Nellie"|Aunt Nellie]] aged 17 years, dressmaker, and [[FOREMAN, (1861) Edward Burr|Edward Burr]] aged 16 years, a hairdresser. [[FOREMAN, (1859) Helen "Nellie"|Aunt Nellie]] lived with her [[NORTH, (1844) Emma Sarah|Aunt Emma Sarah Read]] at Stratford until her marriage to [[MASLEM, (?) Caleb|Caleb Maslem]], a widower with five children.

[[MASLEM, (?) Caleb|Caleb]] has a sawmill at Eltham where they lived. [[FOREMAN, (1859) Helen "Nellie"|Aunt Nellie]] had a hard life with those children and two of her own, [[Maslem, (?) Roy Sydney|Roy Sydney]] and [[MASLEM, (?) Daisy Olive|Daisy Olive]]. [[FOREMAN, (1862) Eliza Kate "Kitty"|Gran]] told me that [[FOREMAN, (1859) Helen "Nellie"|Aunt Nellie]] used to sit up half the night sewing for the children. [[FOREMAN, (1862) Eliza Kate "Kitty"|Gran]] found [[MASLEM, (?) Caleb|Caleb]] a very hard man and had little to do with him.

We lost touch with the children. [[Maslem, (?) Roy Sydney|Roy]] fought in WW1. Then joined the Salvation Army and served overseas. [[FOREMAN, (1859) Helen "Nellie"|Aunt Nellie]] died on 25th April 1906 and is buried at Eltham.
