*Alexander North*

[[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|Alexander North]] was born on 6th May, 1810, at Bishopgate, London, son of [[NORTH, (1789) John|John North]], porter and warehouseman of Old Bethlehem, and [[WAITE, (?) Sarah|Sarah North nee Waite]]. Born within the sound of Bow Bells, he was a true Cockney and proud of it!! He was baptised at [[St. Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, London|St. Botolph's Church, Bishopsgate]], as were his brothers and sisters: [[NORTH, (1812) Elizabeth|Elizabeth]], 1812, [[NORTH, (1814) John|John]], 1814, [[NORTH, (1817) Joseph|Jospeh]], 1817, [[NORTH, (1818) Charlotte|Charlotte]], 1818, [[NORTH, (1821) Caroline|Caroline]], 1821, and [[NORTH, (1823) Thomas George|Thomas George]], 1823. Old Bethlehem was the district where Liverpool Street is today. On 28th December, 1830, [[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|Alexander]] married [[OLIVE, (1806) Eliza|Eliza Olive]], at [[Christ Church, Spitalfields, London]], the same church his [[NORTH, (1789) John|father]] and grandfather had married in.

[[OLIVE, (1806) Eliza|Eliza]], born 6th April, 1806, in the small town of Mayfield, ten miles from Tonbridge across the Kentish border into Sussex, was the daughter of [[OLIVE, (?) John|John Olive]], clockmaker and his wife [[OLIVE, (?) Elizabeth|Elizabeth]]. [[OLIVE, (1806) Eliza|Eliza]] was the fifth of ten children with five sisters and four brothers, and all were baptised at Mayfield. Little serious research has been done on the Olive family but they are easily traced to 1701 and appear to be traceable to the 1500s.

[[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|Alexander's]] marriage certificate gives his occupation as hairdresser. Their first child, [[NORTH, (1831) Ann Olive|Ann Olive North]], was born 25 December, 1831, and was baptised at Mayfield as were all the other children, [[NORTH, (1833) Harriet|Harriet]], 1833, [[NORTH, (1835) Alexander John|Alexander John]], 1835, [[NORTH, (1837) John George|John George]], 1837, [[NORTH, (1839) Thomas|Thomas]], 1839, [[NORTH, (1844) Emma Sarah|Emma Sarah]], 1844, [[NORTH, (1846) George|George]], 1846, and [[NORTH, (1848) Mary Ann|Mary Ann]], 1848. In the 1841 census they were living at [[Walnut Tree House]], Mayfield, but by 1861 they had moved to [[460 High Street, Tonbridge]], where [[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|Alexander]] had his hairdressing business. We have learnt that [[Walnut Tree House]], an Elizabethan half timbered house, over 400 years old, was very attractively restored about 1950, and is one of the historically interesting show places in Hight Street of Mayfield.

By 1861 the older children were away from home. [[NORTH, (1831) Ann Olive|Ann]] had married [[FOREMAN, (1828) Edward Burr|Edward Foreman]] of Hitchin in 1855; [[NORTH, (1833) Harriet|Harriet]] married [[READ, (?) John Nye|John Nye Read]], and [[NORTH, (1837) John George|John George]] married [[PIDGEON, (?) Mary Ann|Mary Ann Pidgeon]] in 1860. In 1862 [[NORTH, (1839) Thomas|Thomas]] set sail from the East India Docks on the "[[Matilda Wattenbach]]" for New Zealand. In 1864 [[NORTH, (1831) Ann Olive|Ann's]] husband, [[FOREMAN, (1828) Edward Burr|Edward Foreman]] died suddenly under suspicious circumstances, and [[NORTH, (1831) Ann Olive|Ann]] appears to have returned with her children, to her [[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|father's]] house in Tonbridge. [[NORTH, (1831) Ann Olive|Ann]] was herself to die at an early age, and her three surviving children came to New Zealand to live. [[FOREMAN, (1861) Edward Burr|Edward]] and [[FOREMAN, (1859) Helen "Nellie"|Nellie (Helen)]] arrived together aboard the [[Waimea]] on 4th October, 1876, while the youngest daughter [[FOREMAN, (1862) Eliza Kate "Kitty"|Eliza Kate]], arrived with her grandfather [[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|Alexander]] in 1877.

The 1860s witnessed great changes amongst the children of [[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|Alexander]]/[[OLIVE, (1806) Eliza|Eliza]]. Their eldest son, [[NORTH, (1835) Alexander John|Alexander John]], married [[CHRISTER, (?) Mary|Mary Christer]] in January 1865, and during that year they appear to have arrived at Lyttleton. The youngest son [[NORTH, (1846) George|George]] also emigrated to New Zealand about the same time. On 14th March, 1869 he married [[WHATMAUGH, (?) Jane Annie|Jane Annie Whatmaugh]] in Christchurch, and the marriage record shows he had been resident two years. The youngest daughter [[NORTH, (1848) Mary Ann|Mary Ann]] died in July 1866, only aged 18 years. She was buried in the [[Tonbridge Cemetery|Tonbridge Municipal Cemetery]], in what was to later become the family plot. The third daughter, [[NORTH, (1844) Emma Sarah|Emma Sarah]], had married [[READ, (?) James|James Read]] in March 1864, and they too decided to sail for New Zealand with their small son [[READ, (?) Willie|Willie]] in 1870. The two oldest married daughters both died during those years, [[NORTH, (1833) Harriet|Harriet Read]] in 1870 and [[NORTH, (1831) Ann Olive|Ann Foreman]] in 1874, and by 1876 [[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|Alexander]] and [[OLIVE, (1806) Eliza|Eliza]] together with their granddaughter [[FOREMAN, (1862) Eliza Kate "Kitty"|Eliza Kate Foreman]], were the sole occupants of [[35 High Street, Tonbridge]].

*Eliza Olive*

They now had living in New Zealand three married sons, a married daughter and several grandchildren, and although [[OLIVE, (1806) Eliza|Eliza]] was now aged 74 years and advised by her doctor not to undertake a sea voyage, they decided to visit New Zealand and bring [[FOREMAN, (1862) Eliza Kate "Kitty"|Eliza Kate Foreman]] with them, who was then aged 15 years. They sailed on the "[[Lady Ruthven]]" on 2nd May, 1877. [[OLIVE, (1806) Eliza|Eliza]] started a diary, [[Eliza North's Diary|and a copy]] shows the first few days of their journey. Five days out, [[OLIVE, (1806) Eliza|Eliza]] died and was buried at sea[^1], and [[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|Alexander]] and [[FOREMAN, (1862) Eliza Kate "Kitty"|Kate]] had to carry on to Port Chalmers alone.

Understandably, [[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|Alexander]] was unhappy in New Zealand and he decided to return to England, leaving [[FOREMAN, (1862) Eliza Kate "Kitty"|Kate]] with her relatives here.

*High Street, Tonbridge, about 1890*

The one son who had remained in England, [[NORTH, (1837) John George|John George]], had taken over [[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|Alexander's]] hairdressing business in Tonbridge. His [[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|father]] returned there, and, in 1880, at the age of 70, he re-married. His second wife was [[HAYDEN, (1836) Mary|Mary Hayden]], a spinster of 44. [[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|Alexander]] lived to the age of 82, dying on 27 September, 1892, at his home, [[Concrete Villas, Lavender Hill, Tonbridge]]. His wife [[HAYDEN, (1836) Mary|Mary]] had pre-deceased him in March of the same year. [[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|Alexander]] is buried in the family plot along with other members of the family, at [[Tonbridge Cemetery|Tonbridge Municipal Cemetery]].

[^1]: Eliza's death five days out to sea may not be correct. According to Eliza's diary the voyage departed 1st May 1877 whereas her date of death is recorded as 15th May 1877. Maybe she had a medical event five days out but didn't pass away immediately. She had previously suffered three strokes and was warned that she wouldn't survive the voyage.
