*Alexander North*

[[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|Alexander North]] was born on 6th May, 1810, at Bishopgate, London, son of [[NORTH, (1789) John|John North]], porter and warehouseman of Old Bethlehem, and [[WAITE, (?) Sarah|Sarah North nee Waite]]. Born within the sound of Bow Bells, he was a true Cockney and proud of it!! He was baptised at [[St. Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, London|St. Botolph's Church, Bishopsgate]], as were his brothers and sisters: [[NORTH, (1812) Elizabeth|Elizabeth]], 1812, [[NORTH, (1814) John|John]], 1814, [[NORTH, (1817) Joseph|Jospeh]], 1817, [[NORTH, (1818) Charlotte|Charlotte]], 1818, [[NORTH, (1821) Caroline|Caroline]], 1821, and [[NORTH, (1823) Thomas George|Thomas George]], 1823. Old Bethlehem was the district where Liverpool Street is today. On 28th December, 1830, Alexander married [[OLIVE, (1806) Eliza|Eliza Olive]], at [[Christ Church, Spitalfields, London]], the same church his father and grandfather had married in.

Eliza, born 6th April, 1806, in the small town of Mayfield, ten miles from Tonbridge across the Kentish border into Sussex, was the daughter of [[OLIVE, (?) John|John Olive]], clockmaker and his wife [[OLIVE, (?) Elizabeth|Elizabeth]]. Eliza was the fifth of ten children with five sisters and four brothers, and all were baptised at Mayfield. Little serious research has been done on the Olive family but they are easily traced to 1701 and appear to be traceable to the 1500s.

Alexander's marriage certificate gives his occupation as hairdresser. Their first child, [[NORTH, (1831) Ann Olive|Ann Olive North]], was born 25 December, 1831, and was baptised at Mayfield as were all the other children, [[NORTH, (1833) Harriet|Harriet]], 1833, [[NORTH, (1835) Alexander John|Alexander John]], 1835, [[NORTH, (1837) John George|John George]], 1837, [[NORTH, (1839) Thomas|Thomas]], 1839, [[NORTH, (1844) Emma Sarah|Emma Sarah]], 1844, [[NORTH, (1846) George|George]], 1846, and [[NORTH, (1848) Mary Ann|Mary Ann]], 1848. In the 1841 census they were living at [[Walnut Tree House]], Mayfield, but by 1861 they had moved to [[460 High Street, Tonbridge]], where Alexander had his hairdressing business. We have learnt that Walnut Tree House, an Elizabethan half timbered house, over 400 years old, was very attractively restored about 1950, and is one of the historically interesting show places in Hight Street of Mayfield.

By 1861 the older children were away from home. Ann had married [[FOREMAN, (1828) Edward Burr|Edward Foreman]] of Hitchin in 1855; Harriet married [[READ, (?) John Nye|John Nye Read]], and John George married [[PIDGEON, (?) Mary Ann|Mary Ann Pidgeon]] in 1860. In 1862 Thomas set sail from the East India Docks on the "[[Matilda Wattenbach]]" for New Zealand. In 1864 Ann's husband, Edward Foreman died suddenly under suspicious circumstances, and Ann appears to have returned with her children, to her father's house in Tonbridge. Ann was herself to die at an early age, and her three surviving children came to New Zealand to live. [[FOREMAN, (1861) Edward Burr|Edward]] and [[FOREMAN, (1859) Helen "Nellie"|Nellie (Helen)]] arrived together aboard the [[Waimea]] on 4th October, 1876, while the youngest daughter [[FOREMAN, (1862) Eliza Kate "Kitty"|Eliza Kate]], arrived with her grandfather Alexander in 1877.

The 1860s witnessed great changes amongst the children of Alexander/Eliza. Their eldest son, Alexander John, married [[CHRISTER, (?) Mary|Mary Christer]] in January 1865, and during that year they appear to have arrived at Lyttleton. The youngest son George also emigrated to New Zealand about the same time. On 14th March, 1869 he married [[WHATMAUGH, (?) Jane Annie|Jane Annie Whatmaugh]] in Christchurch, and the marriage record shows he had been resident two years. The youngest daughter Mary Ann died in July 1866, only aged 18 years. She was buried in the [[Tonbridge Municipal Cemetery]], in what was to later become the family plot. The third daughter, Emma Sarah, had married [[READ, (?) James|James Read]] in March 1864, and they too decided to sail for New Zealand with their small son [[READ, (?) Willie|Willie]] in 1870. The two oldest married daughters both died during those years, Harriet Read in 1870 and Ann Foreman in 1874, and by 1876 Alexander and Eliza together with their granddaughter Eliza Kate Foreman, were the sole occupants of [[35 High Street, Tonbridge]].

*Eliza Olive*

They now had living in New Zealand three married sons, a married daughter and several grandchildren, and although Eliza was now aged 74 years and advised by her doctor not to undertake a sea voyage, they decided to visit New Zealand and bring Eliza Kate Foreman with them, who was then aged 15 years. They sailed on the "[[Lady Ruthven]]" on 2nd May, 1877. Eliza started a diary, [[Eliza North's Diary|and a copy]] shows the first few days of their journey. Five days out, Eliza died and was buried at sea, and Alexander and Kate had to carry on to Port Chalmers alone.

Understandably, Alexander was unhappy in New Zealand and he decided to return to England, leaving Kate with her relatives here.

The one son who had remained in England, John George, had taken over Alexander's hairdressing business in Tonbridge. His father returned there, and, in 1880, at the age of 70, he re-married. His second wife was Mary Hayden, a spinster of 44. Alexander lived to the age of 82, dying on 27 September, 1892, at his home, [[Concrete Villas, Lavender Hill, Tonbridge]]. His wife Mary had pre-deceased him in March of the same year. Alexander is buried in the family plot along with other members of the family, at [[Tonbridge Municipal Cemetery]].
