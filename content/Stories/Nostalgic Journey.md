*By Doreen, Nancy and Bobbie*

In July 1988 three grand-daughters of [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|Elizabeth Ann Foreman]], Doreen, Nancy and Bobbie, decided to do a trip through Taranaki to visit childhood haunts, and included in the trip was a visit to Kaponga where [[FOREMAN, (1861) Edward Burr "Ted"|Edward]] and [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|Elizabeth Foreman]] had brought up their children until [[FOREMAN, (1861) Edward Burr "Ted"|Edward (Ted)]] died in 1918.

We visited the cemetery where the graves are. We spent about two hours in the cemetery, having lunch and cleaning and deciphering the wording on [[FOREMAN, (1861) Edward Burr "Ted"|Edward (Ted) Foreman's]] headstone. We then visited the Anglican Church where two wooden crosses from the First World War graves are hanging in the church. One is [[FAULL, (1894) Henry James "Harry"|Henry James Faull]], second son of [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|Elizabeth Foreman]] and the other one is [[FORD, (1888) William Alexander "Bill"|William Ford]], her brother.

We then proceeded to Hawera to visit [[CALLISTER, (1900) Olive Kate|Olive Old]] with whom we have kept in contact over the years. The rest of the trip we called in to see friends at Patea, Wanganui and on to our brother's place in Palmerston North.

We had a most interesting and enjoyable trip which brought back many happy memories.

One of our highlights was visiting our great Aunt's farm - Eva Wood's (sister of [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|Elizabeth Ann Foreman]]) homestead at Rawhitiroa just out of Eltham. We were sad to see the deterioration of the lovely old home we knew as children. To our astonishment, when visiting an old friend at Patea, we found her brother had purchased the Wood farm several years ago.
