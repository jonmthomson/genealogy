*Copied from the North Family Reunion Booklet (1989)*

*By Mick Foreman*

My mother was [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|Mrs Faull]], who lived in Palmerston North with her four small children, [[FAULL, (1896) Elizabeth (Gladys)|Gladys]], [[FAULL, (1893) William Thomas "Billy"|Bill]], [[FAULL, (1894) Henry James "Harry"|Harry]] and [[FAULL, (1898) Marel Emily "Alma"|Alma]]. When her [[FAULL, (1870) William|husband]] died she moved to Eltham where her two sisters lived. Here she met my [[FOREMAN, (1861) Edward Burr|father]] who was a hairdresser. They married and moved to Kaponga where he owned a Hairdressing and Billiard Salon. Their first child was a daughter named [[FOREMAN, (1902) Olive Annie|Olive]], 15 months later a son named [[FOREMAN, (1904) Edward Alick "Mick"|Edward]] (later to be well known as Mick) then later another daughter, [[FOREMAN, (1906) Helen Doreen "Nellie"|Nellie]] - after [[FOREMAN, (1906) Helen Doreen "Nellie"|Nellie]] another son called [[FOREMAN, (1908) Christopher Raymond "Ray"|Ray]], and finally another daughter named [[FOREMAN, (1910) Dorothy May|Dorothy]]. With her four previous children we all lived together as one happy family.

Then came the war, 1914-1918. [[FAULL, (1893) William Thomas "Billy"|Bill]] and [[FAULL, (1894) Henry James "Harry"|Harry]], together with [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|Mum's]] brothers [[FORD, (1888) William Alexander "Bill"|Bill]] and [[FORD, (1890) Frederick Thomas "Fred"|Fred]], went to the war, out of which only [[FORD, (1890) Frederick Thomas "Fred"|Uncle Fred]] returned, the others are buried in France. During September 1918, [[FOREMAN, (1861) Edward Burr|Dad]] had a stroke, unable to move or speak, dying in November. [[FOREMAN, (1861) Edward Burr|Dad]] thought as much of [[FAULL, (1893) William Thomas "Billy"|Bill]] and [[FAULL, (1894) Henry James "Harry"|Harry]] as of we boys and was hard hit by their deaths, never fully recovering.

We stayed on at Kaponga for another year, when the family, with the exception of me, moved to Dannevirke where [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|Mum]] had purchased Arcadia Tearooms. I stayed on at Kaponga for a further year, working for Mr Betts in his garage. [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|Mum]] didn't like me being away from home and so she arranged a job for me in Dannevirke in a garage and once again the family were together. How long we had the tearooms I can't recall, but besides my garage job I was also operator at the Town Hall pictures. Later I was operator at the Acadia Theatre in Wairoa. I didn't like it there so applied for and received the position of operator at Queen's Theatre, Cuba Street, Wellington, and while there I stayed with [[FOREMAN, (1862) Eliza Kate "Kitty"|Aunty Kate]]. Meanwhile Mum had sold the tearooms and moved to a house in Victoria Avenue, where she kept boarders. From there she once more went into business, this time buying a large private hotel which we named Ranfurly House. By then [[FAULL, (1896) Elizabeth (Gladys)|Gladys]] and [[FAULL, (1898) Marel Emily "Alma"|Alma]] were married, and [[FOREMAN, (1902) Olive Annie|Olive]] and [[FOREMAN, (1906) Helen Doreen "Nellie"|Nellie]] later. In the meantime I had moved to Tauranga and took over a theatre, which after two years failed so I went to Auckland. A few months later I went to work in a garage in Palmerston North and from there back to the Acadia in Dannevirke just at the time when talkies were coming in. [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|Mum]] sold Ranfurly House and she and [[FOREMAN, (1910) Dorothy May|Dos]] moved to Wellington to live. I meanwhile had board with people named Cornwall, whose [[CORNWALL, (1907) Iona (Keitha)|daughter]] I later married.

Our first child [[FOREMAN, (1932) Lois Gay|Lois]] was born in Dannevirke and when she was about two years old my company transferred me to Featherston as manager. Then came the Depression. I worked at Petone, Levin, then came WW2, and I accepted a position at the Regent Theatre at Eltham, just nine miles from Kaponga, my old home town. Before the year was up I was again moved, this time to Lower Hutt where I stayed until I was called up in the Army in 1943. I served in Egypt and Italy returning home in 1946. My wife [[CORNWALL, (1907) Iona (Keitha)|Keitha]] had meantime been given my position of manager of the Theatre. I took over my old job while [[CORNWALL, (1907) Iona (Keitha)|Keitha]] moved to the State Theatre, Petone. Being manager required office work, so following a change of management, with [[CORNWALL, (1907) Iona (Keitha)|Keitha's]] okay we decided to have our own theatres. We bought a small circuit of theatres on the Hauraki Plains, living at Paeroa. It was tough going financially and hard work for the first year. I only had a portable plant which had to be carried up to the various operating boxes, there assembled, and after the screening, the process reversed, to be carefully packed in the van. Finally we fitted the six theatres with their own plant, purchased two more theatres, and taught [[CORNWALL, (1907) Iona (Keitha)|Keitha]] to drive. Later our daughter Lois and her husband became involved in the business and I took up a partnership with the owner of the Regent Theatre in Paeroa, so then we had nine shows to look after. I later bought Whangamata but with the arrival of T.V., better cars and roads, the business gradually went down. I sold some but in the end retained Whangamata which was run mostly by my grandson Neville Cribb, while I went to work as a manager for Amalgamated Theatres. I retired at 65 but the company talked me in to doing relieving work as manager. While in Auckland our daughter Jill was married, then later [[FOREMAN, (1932) Lois Gay|Lois]] died leaving 5 children and [[CORNWALL, (1907) Iona (Keitha)|Keitha]] decided she wanted to be nearer them, so we moved to Waihi Beach. We retained the theatre at Whangamata but with the loss of [[FOREMAN, (1932) Lois Gay|Lois]], [[CORNWALL, (1907) Iona (Keitha)|Keitha]] did not like it any more so we sold it.

Then came the final blow. It was in the fourth year of living at Waihi Beach that my dear wife took ill - was in and out of hospital for some time and died 18/11/77 and her ashes were buried with [[FOREMAN, (1932) Lois Gay|Lois]] in the Paeroa Cemetery. I still live at the beach and in conclusion I might add that no one could have had more wonderful parents than my [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|Mum]] and [[FOREMAN, (1861) Edward Burr|Dad]], nor could I have had a more loving partner than my [[CORNWALL, (1907) Iona (Keitha)|Keitha]], sadly missed by all her grandchildren.
