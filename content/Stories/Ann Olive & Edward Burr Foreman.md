> 
> Long are the particulars respecting the untimely end of [[FOREMAN, (1828) Edward Burr|Mr Edward Foreman]], as announced with the usual formality of a weekly chronicler in these columns, the public have been more than satiated with many and varied reports of the circumstances connected with the sad death.
> 
> [[WILDMAN, James|James Wildman]] deposed. I am a labourer living at Hitchin, on Monday night I was going from my house to Chartlon and about 7 o'clock I met a boy named Beach near the willows at Charlton. Just afterwards I heard a cart coming very fast. It was very dark and I stepped to one side just by the Dog Kennel farm gates to let it pass. I saw it was the miller's mule and cart but [[FOREMAN, (1828) Edward Burr|Mr Foreman]] was not in it. It was the same as I started him off from his own home about 3 o'clock on that afternoon, that was the last time I saw him. Seeing [[FOREMAN, (1828) Edward Burr|Mr Foreman]] was not in it, I ran after the cart and called out to the boy Beach to stop it and he and John Deacon did so. They stopped near Mr Shillitoe's garden and the boy had hold of the reins when I came up. I examined the harness and found nothing broken but the rein was turned around the ring of the cart saddle so it would not work backwards or forwards, (Witness here describes with a ring and piece of tape) this could only be done in harnessing the mule by a juror. There was no blood about the cart. The seat on the cart was always buckled on straps as high as we could place it. The deceased took a rug and whip with him, the rug was found on the Gosmere Road. The whip was not found. I have lived with Mr Burr over three years and never knew [[FOREMAN, (1828) Edward Burr|Mr Foreman]] to have a accident, he knew how to harness a horse.
> 
> [[MEAD, Fredrick|Fredrick Mead]] deposed. I am superintendent of draining and I live at Preston. I was returning home from Stevenage on Monday night and just as I got into the Preston Road from Drift-acre-Lane the Preston clock struck ten. I had gone about one hundred yards in the road and was near Preston Hill when I heard very heavy breathing. I went on and found the deceased lying on the flat of his back with one foot close to the bank and the other foot stretched two feet away, his head was lying in the cart track. I thought he was drunk and I called out to him but got no answer. I took hold of him to try and rouse him. I felt his hands and face and they were nearly cold he was alive and breathing hard. On putting my hand to the back of his head I found it was wet. I could not see if it was blood. I saw a dark mark across the road I supposed to be blood. I then ran home to my step-father Westwood who lives about five minutes walk from the spot. I told him the man was nearly dead and asked him to get the cart out while I went to Preston for help. I ran up to Chequers and got one man from there and another from another place in the village on coming back we found my step-father coming out of the wood with the cart. We then had two lanterns with us. On lifting him into the cat we saw the blood very plainly it was running in streaks and the right eye was sealed with blood. I did not observe whether any blood came from his nose it ran from his right eye to his ear.
> 
> [[NORTH, (1831) Ann Olive|Ann Foreman]] widow of the deceased deposed. My husband left home with the mule and cart about 3 o'clock on Monday afternoon. I saw him pass the window he intended going to Prussell's at Oilley to get a bill paid and to Mr Isaac's to deliver a bill and bring home a bottle of gin and half a pound of tea both these articles came home in the cart. I gave him two sovereigns when he left which he put in his purse, he had a quantity of silver besides I do not know how much I should think over 20s he was not going to pay away any of this money. The purse he carried was one I made myself, it was a yellow purse and I should know it again if I saw it, he did not usually wear two waistcoats but he did on this day. He had his pocket book with him when he went away. He usually carried that in the inside breast pocket of his coat. He wore no watch on that day as it was away being cleaned. He had no other articles about him of value when he left home.

> 
> Crown Court Friday. The Chief Baron took his seat at 9 o'clock. [[WABY, Samuel|Samuel Waby]], labourer of Ippollitts, was charged with stealing money from the person of [[FOREMAN, (1828) Edward Burr|Edward Foreman]], since deceased at Hitchin. His Lordship sentenced [[WABY, Samuel|Waby]] the prisoner for four years penal servitude and ordered the boy, Harmer, to be kept in custody on the charge of making false statements on oath.
> 
> After some deliberation on the part of the jury, the foreman pronounced that they were unanimously of the opinion that the deceased met his death by violence and a verdict was returned of "Wilful murder, against some person or persons unknown."
> 
> N.B. I have read the inquest and court case many times and have concluded that finding the person who stole the money was more important than finding the murderer. As it still remains murder against person or persons unknown.

The ship was becalmed for some time, the Captain always drunk leaving the first mate to bring them into port.
