I am not too sure about [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|Elizabeth Ford's]] early life. My [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|grandmother]] came to live with us when my [[CLEVERLEY, (1911) Gordon George|father]] went away to WW2 and one of my deepest regrets is that I didn't talk to her about the old days. She was born in Christchurch on 24th May, 1874 and at some stage her parents moved to Rawhitiroa, just out of Eltham, where her [[FORD, Henry James|father]] had a brick kiln. Her first husband, [[FAULL, (1870) William|Mr Faull]], is a bit of a mystery, it's rumoured that he was a drinker, but [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|Elizabeth]] must have been only 17 or 18 when she married him. I'm not sure where the couple lived but [[FAULL, (1898) Marel Emily "Alma"|Alma]] was born in Palmerston North. After her [[FAULL, (1870) William|husband's]] death, [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|Elizabeth]] moved back to Eltham and helped out at a boarding house run by her sisters Pat[^1] and Eva. [[FOREMAN, (1861) Edward Burr|Edward Foreman]] had a hairdressing salon in Eltham and presumably boarded at the Ford sisters' establishment. All three sisters were striking looking women and one can imagine there were plenty of suitors, even for [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|Elizabeth]] who was burdened with four young children. It is said that the family were outraged by [[FOREMAN, (1861) Edward Burr|Edward's]] decision to marry [[FORD, (1874) Elizabeth Ann|Elizabeth]] whom they regarded as a scheming young widow! Looking at their wedding photo it is easy to see why he fell in love with her. She had a lovely nature too. Certainly I can never remember a harsh or critical word from her about anyone in all the years she was with us. Despite a sad and very hard life she remained a fine looking woman to the last, with a gentle nature and not an ounce of bitterness in her soul.




[^1]: "Pat" isn't listed as a child of "Emily Ann Ford" in NZ births registry. Was "Pat" a nickname for Sarah Ann Ford?
