*ARRIVAL OF THE 'MATILDA WATTENBACH*

Yesterday morning the good ship '[[Matilda Wattenbach]]' 954 tons, Captain W. Goudie, with 352 passengers of the nonconformist body, and a general cargo, came to an anchor in the harbour after a quick passage of 98 days from Gravesend. Left Gravesend on the 2nd June, made the Lizards on the 9th, and Madeira on the 17th. On the 27th of the same month, in latitude 8° north, 21° west longitude, spoke[^1] the Prussian corvette 'Altona' and put letters on board for home. Passed Cape de Verde[^2] and Canary Islands without sighting any of them, and crossed the equator on 4th July, in 22° west longitude. Light southerly and variable winds had been experienced up to this date. On the 17th July, struck a leading wind off Rio[^3], and on the 27th, made the parallel of Cape of Good Hope, where she experienced strong heavy gales of westerly wind, and lost her main and mizen topmast. Ran down the easting between the parallels of 45° and 49°, and on the 28th August passed Van Diemen's Land. Sighted the Three Kings on the 2nd inst, and anchored on Sunday off Rangitoto. Yesterday morning rounded the North Head, and came to an anchor in the harbour at 9 o'clock. Two births occurred during the passage, and five deaths: three children died of convulsions and teething, a young woman named Mary Ann Becroft, aged 19 years, of phthisis, after three months' illness, and a fatal accident occurred on June 23rd, to an able bodied seaman named William Robertson, who fell from the fore topmast head, and received such serious injuries as caused his death six hours afterwards. Otherwise the general condition of the passengers' health has been very satisfactory. The 'Matilda Wattenbach' is in a cleanly condition, and the passengers speak highly of the treatment they received from the captain and officers during the voyage.

[^1]: In 19th-century nautical terminology, the verb **"spoke"** was commonly used to mean **"communicated with"** or **"exchanged messages with"** another ship at sea. When ships encountered one another during long voyages (before modern radio communication), they would signal each other visually (via flags, lights, or written messages tossed between vessels) or by voice (shouting across short distances).

[^2]: Now called Cabo Verde.

[^3]: "Rio" is this location a transcription mistake?
