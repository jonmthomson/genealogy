*Copy of the pages of [[OLIVE, (1806) Eliza|Eliza North's]] diary, as she left England to visit her family in New Zealand. She took ill and died on 15th May, and was buried at sea.*

Went on board the [[Lady Ruthven]] in the West India Dock began to move out of the basin at 12:30pm and arrived at Gravesend about 6 in the evening without a hitch and do not feel the least motion in the vessel. Weather fine.

May 1st. Left Gravesend about 2.30 lighted (?) down to beachhead and the Pilot left the ship about 12. Weather fine but cold. Felt a bit giddy by the motion of the ship. Wind was very cold for two days.

May 2nd. My ever dear children how I would like to know how you all are, I can't, so I will not think about it. I do hope you have had two letters one I wrote after Mr R. left the ship and one the Pilot took when he left in the night, it will be bad for you if you have not got them. I hope my dear that you can read what I write the lighting is so dark. When it gets warmer I shall be able to write on deck. After [[NORTH, (1810) Alexander|your dear father]] was in bed last night the Steward came to our cabin and said he had come to tell us how to block our things up for the wind was so high he expected a storm. You are sure we were very sorry to hear that the ship rolled and [[FOREMAN, (1862) Eliza Kate "Kitty"|Kitty]] and me felt giddy. Went to bed as soon as we could. Your father and I did not sleep much but the Lord was better than all our doubt and fears. We got up in the morning relaxed though not with sleep. I should like Kitty to be here to tell me how to spell but she has got two nice companions. Clergyman's daughters they seemed to take to Kitty, they seem between 20 & 30 such nice ladies. Their cabin is at the back of ours, we sit next to them at our meals. Dear Ma and Eliza know how our cabin is, if you remember there is one cabin before we get to ours, that's where two gentlemen sleep, then the two opposite a lady and gentleman and five children. The youngest is two and a half years old and I think their eldest is sixteen or seventeen. They have two cabins. They have put their boxes in the ? where the steps are. I thought I had I had better tell you incase any of you come out. Your father and Kitty are up on deck all day but it is too cold for me to stay long. I am so glad I have put the mattress under Kitty's bed. In the night your father went to get of bed and fell down. What a mercy he didn't hurt himself only a bruised leg. The beds are not fit for old people.

May 3rd. Off the coast of Brighstone[^1] about 10am. Wind blew more backwards than forwards. Wind cold, ship about one knot per hour. Evening a little more wind. Not anything to note.

May 4th. Morning sight the Isle of Wight about 10am. It looked very beautiful not much wind, very steady and sun shines. And fine.

[^1]: In the original transcription this was "Brighelstone" which doesn't exist. Brighstone is a village on the Isle of Wight which the vessel would have passed heading West through the English Channel.
